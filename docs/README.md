## New Developments: TR-1 Launch, TR-1X/TR-2 Development!
**4.10.2020**

January 20, 2020 saw the launch of TR-1, the first fully 3D printed high power rocket. Flying on a G77R-7, it had a top speed of 232 mph (104m/s), and reached an altitude of 1,364 feet (416 m). With the flight of TR-1, we're announcing three new things!

First of all, we're announcing the **California Model Aerospace Store!** It should be accessible beginning today [here!](https://cmaero.space/store/store.html]. Currently, TR-1 and replacement mounts are available for sale. All orders are currently made to ship, and will take about two weeks to arrive.

Next up, we have two new developments: TR-1X and TR-2.
TR-1X is a supersonic, minimum diameter version of the 29mm TR-1. It can go supersonic on a G80 NBT (Mach 1.2!) and is equivalent in role to an Apogee Aspire, however, with a major difference: TR-1X absolutely bypasses the need for high strength heat baffles to prevent recovery systems from burning. This is done by routing ejection charge gases through the walls of the rocket, while keeping the parachute in the middle safe. This saves a lot of risk when it comes to heat protection!

The second development, TR-2, is a 108mm rocket. It is compatible with 38 and 54 millimeter motors. We can't comment too much on TR-2's current status, but it will be here within the year!

Lastly, stay safe, everyone. We truly wish the best for everyone out there! Fly safe,

Lavie Ohana, California Model Aerospace CEO/Founder.

## Coming Soon: Tritium Zero (TR-0)
**9.12.2019**

  Low cost, medium power rocketry: TR-0. With options for both 24mm and 29mm motor mounts, it comes as a 3 piece airframe that is projected to cost only $9.99 (Subject to change, preliminary estimate.). With a 54mm wide airframe, it's a minute-long build, coming in 3 blocks, the lower block, containing the motor mount, lower body, and fins, the upper block, which contains a heat baffle, and room for a parachute (24 inch is reccomended), and the nosecone. These all friction fit, and so far the 24mm variant has been tested with an E30-4T resulting in an extremely stable flight to an estimated 1,130 feet. 

Video of the first flight of TR-0 coming soon, however, it can be seen as the large, purely orange rocket in the "Going Commercial" video. Release is targeted for Winter 2019/20.

**Infographic is accurate to the original TR-0 prototype. The commercial version will be longer, and considerably lighter. The prototype used a 90% density nose cone, which is mass inefficient, but made the short stubby design stable, which was necessary due to restrictions at the time.*
