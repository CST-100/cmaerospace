## Project Restart
**3.28.2021**
*Lavie Ohana* 

After an over one year long break, CMA is being revived - from scratch, more or less. Let's explain that in more detail:

### Why restart?

The project had goals that were too lofty, and I never had enough time to complete them. The pace was unbearably slow - just one launch per year - but I still expected to get a high degree of support. That's just not possible. From now on, I'm taking a balanced, yet rapid, approach, focused on prototyping and branching out. The baseline of CMA is still the same - cost efficiency via additive manufacturing - but I'd like to branch out to more than just airframes. Flight computers (not TVC yet!), motors, and other complex systems are stuff that I'd like to try and will be enabled by this project.

### What's being scrapped?

Everything but the TR-1 project. TR-1, for those who don't know, is a 54mm, fully 3D-printed rocket capable of L1 certification. I've flown it once before on a G77, the footage of that exists somewhere (albeit with the inclusion of my little brother screaming), but that's beside the point. I'm actively working on reviving it for another attempt as soon as next month, so stay tuned. (It needs new fins, a new upper body, and a couple other things.)

The TR-1X project, which was supposed to be a 29mm minimum diameter Mach-breaker rocket, is being scrapped. It doesn't fit the budget, and it's a bit too much effort for a rocket I'll likely never get back.

The CMA store and Patreon are on hold - for now. I vastly misjudged how successful the project would be with me putting minimum effort into it, and the overruns led to those not being viable. Besides, I don't think it's worth asking for money for a project that barely does anything so far. Once enough people want to support it, I may consider starting those back up. 

The TR-2 project, which is, as the name suggests, an upscaled TR-1 meant for L2 at a 108mm diameter, is on hiatus. I'd love to build a rocket that big someday - but we're just not there yet. Low-cost, mid-power is the name of the game right now. What can we get done on a shoestring budget? Well...

### What's new? 

CMA is being restarted on a ~$250 budget.
